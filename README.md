## Version Support Policy

### Supported Minecraft Versions

Orebfuscator follows a **rolling support window** for Minecraft versions.

Starting with **Minecraft 27.x**, Orebfuscator will officially support **only the two most recent major Minecraft releases**.

Example:

| Latest Minecraft Version | Supported Versions |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| 27.x                     | 27.x and 26.x      |
| 28.x                     | 28.x and 27.x      |

When a new major Minecraft version is released, the oldest supported version will be dropped in a future Orebfuscator release.

Older versions may still work but are **not guaranteed to receive fixes or compatibility updates**.

### Testing Policy

Testing policy differs depending on the Minecraft release cycle.

**Until Minecraft 27.x**

Each Orebfuscator release is tested against all supported Minecraft versions on PaperMC and Spigot with the following exceptions:

- 1.17.x
- 1.18.x
- 1.19.x

The following versions are still included in testing:

- 1.16.5
- 1.20.x and newer supported releases

**After Minecraft 27.x**

Testing will focus on the **latest Minecraft major version only** for each Orebfuscator release.

Other versions within the support window may remain compatible but will not necessarily be tested for every release.

Servers running untested versions may still function, but issues specific to those versions may not be prioritized.

### Legacy support
For compatibility with Java 11 or Minecraft 1.9.4 and later, you can use any legacy release prior to version 5.5.0. Please note that these legacy releases will no longer receive regular support or updates. However, they may receive critical security and vulnerability patches if necessary.

### Maven
